 * What even does this need?
 * I've got lots of but what really do I need
 * Pretty much every time I need
 * - memory allocation
 * - pointer hashmap
 * - string manipulation
 *
 * Is that all I need?  What do I need to start?
 * We could just ignore the custom allocators?  Do we need that?
 * I mean I know we may, but now?  and how am I supposed to do that?
 * I don't even have requirements.  I don't even have a plan.
 *
 * Can I just use the stb_ds.h?
